Stacking 1-tile furni at multiple heights","text":"<p>Tip</p> <p>Stacking multiple heights is a bit tricky. Using 4 rollers in a circle will make it easier.</p> <p></p> <p>For this part, I'll show you how to stack 3 Lodge corner plinths. However, you can use this technique to stack more than 3 lodge corner plinths, and even stack different furni on multiple heights. You see this used a lot in arcade rooms.</p> <p>First, stack up 2 furni as instructed in chapter 2. Then, just before the 2-high stack you built starts moving to the next roller, place a Z-table where the stack is going to move. This will cause the existing stack to move up one Z-table height. Do this three more times, and then place the bottom furni with the timing from chapter 1.</p> <p>Be aware that the timing to move a stack on top of the Z-table has a different timing than normal stacking! It's a bit tricky at first, but with enough practice you'll get the hang of it.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"tutorials/stacking/#4-stacking-2-tile-furni","title":"4.

For example:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p>You place down a table with a TV. You then place a plant on that same table tile. The TV and plant are now merged.</p> </li> <li> <p>You place two Z-tables on top of eachother. You place another one. The two top-most Z-tables are now merged.</p> </li> <li> <p>You place a Z-table. You place a Lodge Room Divider on top of it. You place another Lodge Room Divider on top of it. The game shouldn't have allowed you to do this, but has done it anyway. No rollers required.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorials/stacking/#my-theory","title":"My theory","text":"<p>I have no insights into the Habbo Origins code. However, I discovered multi-width furni stacking by trying to figure out what was causing this bug.</p> <p>My theory is this:</p> <p>When a furni is placed into a tile, the tile should determine:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Is this new furni positioned higher than other furni? If so, register it as the highest</p> </li> <li> <p>If the new furni is the highest, can new items be placed on top of the furni?</p> </li> <li> <p>If so, tell the tile that it can accept a new item placement, and place it above the current highest furni.</p> </li> </ul> <p>However, somehow that is not what happends. As far as I can tell, furni within a tile are placed in a sort of \"queue\", sorted based on who entered the tile first.  Furni are only removed from this queue when they are removed from the tile.</p> <p>When checking whether a new furni can be placed, the tile checks the oldest item placed in the queue. If the oldest item can be stacked upon, simply stack the new furni on top. It does not check whether the space above the oldest item is already occupied, which allows for merging items (e.g. lodge dividers).</p> <p></p> <p>The stacking technique in chapter 4 works because each time a Z-table is added, it gets appended to the queue. The user then removes the bottom-most Z-table, removing it from the queue. When placing a new item, the tile then checks whether the 2nd-oldest-item, now at the top of the queue, is stackable- which it is.</p> <p>If the 2nd item to enter the tile was a Lodge Divider, and a 3rd item a Z-table, this stacking would not work; the Lodge Divider would be the 'oldest item' in the queue, and cannot be stacked upon. I've demonstrated this in a gif.</p> <p>TL:DR</p> <p>Tiles should keep track of the topmost tile. Instead of this being one furni, it is an array sorted from old to new. Only the oldest furni gets checked if items can be stacked on top of it, allowing for merging of furni. </p>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2023/","title":"December 2023","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/server-management/","title":"Server Management","text":""},{"location":"blog/tags/","title":"Tags","text":""},{"location":"blog/tags/#linux","title":"Linux","text":"<ul> <li>Testpost</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#server-tips","title":"Server tips","text":"<ul> <li>Testpost</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#tf2","title":"TF2","text":"<ul> <li>Testpost</li> </ul>"}]}
